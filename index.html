                              <a href="https://www.thetaco.co/">The Taco Company</a> represents F&M's first major venture.
                              Conceptualized in early 2023, The Taco Company is a full-service Tex-Mex restaurant started
                              inspired by Jamestown's legendary Tex-Mex restaurant, Taco Hut. After it's closure in 2020,
                              Taco Hut's head manager, Heather Gregory, joined Ryan Fitzpatrick's team at Phil n' Cindy's
                              where customers raved about her tacos and relentlessly asked when they would be available again.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              After months of proving the concept at Phil n' Cindy's with their Thursday "Taco Nights",
                              Ryan and Nate decided to take the plunge and open a full-service restaurant dedicated to
                              serving the best tacos in town. The Taco Company opened in the summer of 2024 and has been
                              successful in bringing back the flavors and service the people of Jamestown have been missing.

                              <a href="https://philncindys.com/">Phil n' Cindy's Lunch</a> is a casual breakfast and lunch diner
                              that has been a staple in Jamestown for decades. Originally opened by Phil and Cindy, the
                              restaurant was passed down to Ryan Fitzpatrick in 2021. Ryan has been working at the diner
                              since he was just a kid, and had planned on taking over the business when Phil and Cindy retired.

                           <p>
                              After years of learning how to run the business, cook the food, and serve the customers, Ryan
                              was well prepared to take over the business and has been successful in maintaining the
                              restaurant's reputation for great food and friendly service. Phil n' Cindy's Lunch is a
                              favorite among locals and visitors alike, and has been a great platform for Ryan to test new
                              concepts and build relationships with customers and employees.

                              Currently, the building is home to The Taco Company as well as the F&M headquarters,
                              but with a second floor currently fully built-out for food manufacturing and distribution,
                              F&M is exploring opportunities to expand the building's use and bring new businesses and

                              F&M was founded in 2023 by Nathan Margaglio and Ryan Fitzpatrick, longtime friends who
                              first connected in at Jamestown High School and who have remained close ever since.
                              Combining their complementary skill sets, Nathan brings a strong technical and financial
                              focus, while Ryan leverages his deep operational experience in the restaurant world to
                              provide exceptional service and hospitality to customers and employees.
                              Together, they've built a partnership founded on trust and a shared passion for creating
                              thriving businesses where people enjoy working, dining, and connecting.
